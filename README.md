# Noteful

## Summary

Created in coordination with my Thinkful curriculum, this full-stack app allows users to create and organize notes.

The Noteful client-side allows users to create and delete notes as well as view notes by corresponding folders. The user can also create new folders. The app's server-side was also written by me (as guided by the Thinkful curriculum) [here](https://github.com/SabrinaSides/noteful-server).
